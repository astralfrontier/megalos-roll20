Special Fields
--------------

You can double-click on the following fields to get a list of values: **Class**, **Calling**, **Role**, and **Skill Names**.

If you supply the _exact_ name (by choosing from the drop-down) for class, calling, and role, it will enable special sheet features. If something on the sheet isn't automatically working for some reason, check your class and calling!

Bonds
-----

Each row of bonds has two fields: a text input (for the bond text) and a checkbox (to indicate the bond is Stressed). Currently, the Stressed status does _not_ mechanically impact anything on the sheet.

Skills
------

Clicking on the roll button for skills will roll a check on that skill. It will prompt you for the difficulty, and tell you whether you succeeded or failed. On success, it will tell you how many hits you got. Subtract the Resistance from the roll to see how many excess hits you got (or Surges for attack rolls).

Traits
------

Each Trait has a die roll button next to it. This allows you to reroll an action by invoking that trait.

Weapons
-------

"CD" means "Core Damage". This is the base damage for the weapon. When you roll to attack with the weapon, it will output the Core Damage, +1 for each Aether Current die you set to "Throne Damage" if you are a Throne.

Aether Current Dice
-------------------

Your Aether Current dice have several potential values:

- **Used** (a generic value meaning the die has been consumed by something)
- **Available** (a generic value meaning the die is ready for use)
- **Throne Damage** (adds +1 to Core Damage rolls when your class is set to Throne)
- **Astral Seal** and **Umbral Seal** (for Invokers)
- **Weak Charge** and **Surging Charge** (for Witches)

Clicking on the roll button will roll 1d6 in the chat log. If your class is set correctly, it will also automatically set the Aether Current value for you, based on the roll.
